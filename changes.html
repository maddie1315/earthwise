				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="odd">Be More Informed</h2>
					<p>One of the most difficult things about trying to be more sustainable is knowing where to start – and, more importantly, where to shop. Thankfully, it's now much easier than it once was; there are so many brands that operate with a sustainable focus in mind. Transparency is key when it comes to sustainability, so be sure to find out where a brand sources its materials, what they're made from and how sustainable its production process is.</p>

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="even">Change Your Attitude Towards Shopping</h2>
					<p>Every new item of clothing made has a substantial carbon footprint attached to its manufacturing, but the amount of new energy needed to produce vintage clothing is zero. Another eco-friendly way to keep your wardrobe updated is to opt for rental fashion. Given that 300,000 tons of unwanted clothes are binned, not recycled, every year, it's clear that sharing our wardrobes and contributing to the circular economy is a step toward a more sustainable future.</p>

			<article class="change-three">
				<img src="images/change-three.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="odd">The 30 Wears Test</h2>
					<p>Try to veer away from buying that statement piece you know you are only going to wear for one occasion, and instead invest in something with more longevity that you can wear again and again. Pick more versatile pieces that can be styled in different ways, rather than that one item you know is going to fall out of fashion in no time.</p>
				</div>

			<article class="change-four">
				<img src="images/change-four.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="even">Invest in Trans-Seasonal Clothing</h2>
					<p>Only buy items that you know are going to work for you all year round. Spend the bulk of your money on pieces that will see you through more than one season. Jeans, T-shirts, classic dresses, timeless coats and jackets will make for a much more sustainable wardrobe.</p>
				</div>

			<article class="change-five">
				<img src="images/change-five.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="odd">Go for Quality Over Quantity</h2>
					<p>Buying better quality, more sustainable pieces is likely to cost you more money than buying a cheap high-street product that doesn't tick the right boxes. However, it's all about changing your mindset. Yes, it costs more, but you're likely to have it for longer and will be buying less per season overall. Buying 10-30 high-quality items a year, rather than 60 cheaper, less eco-friendly pieces, will dramatically reduce your carbon footprint. Basically, save up, invest and buy less.</p>

			<article class="change-six">
				<img src="images/change-six.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="even">Look After Your Clothes so They Last Longer</h2>
					<p>It sounds obvious, but it's so important. If you buy higher quality clothes, they are likely to last longer (and you're also more likely to treat them more carefully because they were more expensive), but this goes for everything hanging in your wardrobe. Look after them properly and you will have to replace things less often. Go the extra mile to ensure your clothes stay at their best for longer.</p>

			<article class="change-seven">
				<img src="images/change-seven.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="odd">Learn how to Repair Clothing (or Find a Good Tailor)</h2>
					<p>When something rips or a heel breaks, you don't necessarily have to throw it away. Learn how to repair your clothes and accessories – or, even easier, pay a professional to do it. Think twice before using it as an excuse for something new.</p>
				</div>

			</article>

			<article class="change-eight">
				<img src="images/change-eight.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="even">Donate Your Unwanted Clothes</h2>
					<p>Donating your unwanted clothes to a good cause, rather than leaving them hanging in your wardrobe, will help others to be more sustainable; they will invest in your old pieces, rather than buying something new. A great way to do this is to have a one-in, one-out policy – live by the mantra that every time you buy something, you'll donate something.</p>
				</div>

			<article class="change-nine">
				<img src="images/change-nine.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="odd">Adjust how you Spend Your Money</h2>
					<p>Change what you splurge on. Instead of spending your savings on a dress for a wedding or a pair of shoes that you'll only wear for special occasions, spend your 'investment' cash on the things you wear every day. After a few seasons, you will have a high-quality, sustainable wardrobe to be proud of.</p>

			<article class="change-ten">
				<img src="images/change-ten.jpg" alt="">

				<div class="change-content">
					<h2 class="even">Change Your Perspective</h2>
					<p>With more and more brands seeing the importance of an environmental focus, dressing sustainably no longer means compromising – so stop thinking it does.</p>
